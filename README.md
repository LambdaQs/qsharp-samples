# qsharp-samples

This directory contains example Q# programs taken from the [Q# libraries](https://github.com/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/), [Q# Katas](https://github.com/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/), and Q# coding contents ([used in the evaluation of Silq](https://github.com/eth-sri/silq)).
Our intention is to use these programs as a test suite for code that manipulates Q# programs.
The sources for these program are included in the `submodules` directory. The `copy.sh` script copies and renames select select files from the `submodules` directory to the `Libraries`, `Katas`, and `Contests` directories. 

See [github.com/ebraminio/awesome-qsharp](https://github.com/ebraminio/awesome-qsharp) for a complete list of resources for programming with Q#.
